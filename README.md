# LinuxSystemProgramming_ls_chmod_touch
I made Linux command ls, chmod, touch.
You can use these three commands with myls.c, mychmod.c, mytouch.c
# First, you can use four options l, i, t, a in myls.
Usage : myls [options] filename or pathname
  
# Second, you can use mychmod with number option or alphabet.
Usage : mychmod [options] filename
  
# Third, you can use mytouch only with c option
Usage : mytouch [options] filename
